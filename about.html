    <h1>Hello, I'm Madina</h1>
    <p>In 2019, I moved to Germany with my family. It was a difficult journey and still remains a path full of obstacles. Integrating into a new culture, learning the language, understanding the social hierarchy, and raising children has not been easy.</p>

    <p>In Uzbekistan, where I come from, I worked as a journalist. Later, I immigrated to Turkey and worked as a translator in a clinic. In Germany, a new profession awaited me — and I chose programming.</p>

    <p>In 2023, I started learning programming on my own, beginning with Java. Of course, I studied Spring, Maven, Docker, Hibernate, Git, Kubernetes, SQL — about 250 hours of training.</p>

    <p>At first, it was difficult to understand the world of computer science. Spring was challenging, I was fascinated by databases — but I overlooked one thing: without practice and without real work, what I learned through tears would quickly be forgotten. That's why I started creating this website — to apply the theory I gained from courses and continue learning.</p>

    <p>Programming no longer seems scary to me. Everything in it is explainable, logical, and interesting.</p>

    <p>Getting the first job is hard. Especially when you have no work experience. Many beginner programmers know this path filled with doubts and rejections. You can’t find a job because you have no experience, and you can’t gain experience because you have no job. On top of that, a beginner often doesn’t even know how to gain experience. At least, that’s how it was for me.</p>

    <p>Recently, I started learning IAM (Identity and Access Management). Back in 2008–2011, I worked as a forum administrator and managed several websites, so this area felt familiar to me.</p>

    <p>Currently, I want to build independent projects to practice the theory I've learned. That’s why I created this website.</p>

    <p>Welcome!</p>
